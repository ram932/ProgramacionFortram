PROGRAM ONE_D_MOTION
IMPLICIT NONE
  
! Program for the motion of a particle subject to an external force f(x) = -x.
! We have divided the total time 2*pi into 10000 intervals with an equal time
! step. The position and velocity of the particle are written out at every 500
! steps.

 REAL, DIMENSION (N):: T,V,X
